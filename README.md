This is notes from three months intensive Data Scientist BootCamp. For later using and for continously learning and improving. 

We kicked off the BootCamp with data analysis and machine learning with Python on a different project each week. Using the pandas library to rapidly wrangle and visualize datasets, as well as learned to train models with scikit-learn and also deep dive into the maths behind the models, and learn to optimize model performance and discuss business cases. Eventually we reached Deep Learning.

Thanks to [Spiced Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/data-science) who has provides great courses. It enabled me to start a new carrer.

These are notes from three months intensive Data Scientist BootCamp. For continuously learning as well as improving. 

The BootCamp started with data analysis and machine learning with Python on a different project each week. Using the pandas library to rapidly wrangle and visualize datasets, as well as learned to train models with scikit-learn and also deep dive into the maths behind the models, and learn to optimize model performance and discuss business cases. Eventually we reached Deep Learning.

The Road never ends like learning itself. :nerd_face:

1. This is a project of 'Hello World' machine learning model. However to make it more fun, and understanding ML process better, I have build logistic regression with numpy. 

2. The following sklearn models were used:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - RandomForest
    - VotingClassifier
    
3. General ML steps were applied in this project, which contains following steps:
    - Define goal.
    - Import data.
    - Split data to train and test.
    - Exploring data.
    - Feature engineering.
    - Fit Model.
    - Train Model.
    - Cross Validation.
    - Check on Confusion Matrix.
    - Ensemble the models to get a better score.
    - Test model on test data.

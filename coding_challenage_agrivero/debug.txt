# Task 2: Deep Learning (Estimated time: 15 min)
- The provided code includes errors.
- Please identify the errors and describe then in 1-2 sentences. Result to hand in: a txt file

This is a CNN network, the aim is at handeling 16 pictures, with 3 classes. However befor loading img, we need to do 2 steps:
1. turn img into fload data type, using image.img_to_array(img) 
2. ture size into shpe (1, 224, 224, 3) using np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)# sizeä¸º(1, 224, 224, 3)

The next bug i suspect is: 
3. the last layer using /activation='sigmoid'/ is not correct if it is a 3 classes classfier. However softmax would pass better.
